# Coxsackievirus A6 Nextstrain Analysis

This repository provides a comprehensive Nextstrain analysis of Coxsackievirus A6. You can choose to perform either a **VP1 run (>=600 base pairs)** or a **whole genome run (>=6400 base pairs)**.

For those unfamiliar with Nextstrain or needing installation guidance, please refer to the [Nextstrain documentation](https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/).

### Enhancing the Analysis
Most of the data for this analysis can be obtained from [NCBI Virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/). Instructions for downloading sequences are provided at the end of this README under [Sequences](#sequences). 
Some data here are private contributions from several clinics and authors in China, France and the UK. If you have relevant data such as sequences, patient age, spatial data and clinical outcomes and are willing to share, please contact me at [nadia.neuner-jehle@swisstph.ch](mailto:nadia.neuner-jehle@swisstph.ch).


## Repository Organization
This repository includes the following directories and files:

- `ingest`: Contains Python scripts and the `snakefile` for automatic downloading of CVA6 sequences and metadata.
- `scripts`: Custom Python scripts called by the `snakefile`.
- `snakefile`: The entire computational pipeline, managed using Snakemake. Snakemake documentation can be found [here](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
- `vp1`: Sequences and configuration files for the **VP1 run**.
- `whole_genome`: Sequences and configuration files for the **whole genome run**.

### Configuration Files
The `config`, `vp1/config`, and `whole_genome/config` directories contain necessary configuration files:
- `colors.tsv`: Color scheme
- `geo_regions.tsv`: Geographical locations
- `lat_longs.tsv`: Latitude data
- `dropped_strains.txt`: Dropped strains
- `clades_genome.tsv`: Virus clade assignments
- `reference_sequence.gb`: Reference sequence
- `auspice_config.json`: Auspice configuration file

The reference sequence used is [Gdula, accession number AY421764](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AY421764), sampled in 1949.

## Quickstart

### Setup

#### Nextstrain Environment
Install the Nextstrain environment by following [these instructions](https://docs.nextstrain.org/en/latest/guides/install/local-installation.html).

### Running a Build

Activate the Nextstrain environment:
```
conda activate nextstrain
```

To perform a build, run:
```
snakemake --cores 1
```

For specific builds:
- VP1 build:
    ```
    snakemake auspice/cv_a6_vp1.json --cores 1
    ```
- Whole genome build:
    ```
    snakemake auspice/cv_a6_whole_genome.json --cores 1
    ```

### First steps
To run the ingest, you will need some specific reference files, such as a `reference.fasta` or `annotation.gff3` file.
1. In the `config` file: check that the taxid is correct
2. To get these files you have to run the script [generate_from_genbank.py](ingest/bin/generate_from_genbank.py) manually. 
    If you want to have two reference files for whole genome and VP1, you can choose a similar way:
    ```
    > python3 ingest/bin/generate_from_genbank.py --reference "AY421764.1" --output-dir "whole_genome/config/"
    ```
    - You need to specify a few things: [0];[product];[2].
    - It will create the files in the subdirectory `data/references`. 
    - These files will be used by the `ingest` snakefile.
3. Check that the `attributes` in `data/references/pathogen.json` are up to date.
4. Run the `ingest` snakefile (either manually or using the main snakefile).
    - Depending on your system you may need to run `chmod +x ./vendored/*; chmod +x ./bin/*` first.
5. Run the main snakefile.

### Visualizing the Build
To visualize the build, use Auspice:
```
auspice view --datasetDir auspice
```
To run two visualizations simultaneously, you may need to set the port:
```
export PORT=4001
```

### Sequences
Sequences can be downloaded manually or automatically.

1. **Manual Download**: Visit [NCBI Virus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/labs/virus/vssi/#/), search for `CVA6` or Taxid `86107`, and download the sequences.
2. **Automated Download**: The `ingest` functionality, included in the main `snakefile`, handles automatic downloading.

The ingest pipeline is based on the Nextstrain [RSV ingest workflow](https://github.com/nextstrain/rsv.git). Running the **ingest** pipeline produces `data/metadata.tsv` and `data/sequences.fasta`.

### Updating Vendored Scripts
This repository uses [`git subrepo`](https://github.com/ingydotnet/git-subrepo) to manage copies of ingest scripts in `ingest/vendored`. To pull new changes from the central ingest repository, first install `git subrepo` and then follow the instructions in [ingest/vendored/README.md](./ingest/vendored/README.md#vendoring).
